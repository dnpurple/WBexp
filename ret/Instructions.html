<p>This is an experiment in the economics of decision-making.
    The simple instructions are explained below, and if you follow them carefully and make good decisions,
    you may earn a CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF MONEY, which will be PAID TO YOU IN CASH at the end of the experiment.  </p>



<p>In this experiment, you will act as part of a firm.
    The participants in this room will be split up into 3 firms and receive one of three roles within that firm.
    You will be assigned one of the following three roles:</p>


<ul>
    <li> Authority </li>

    <li> Manager </li>

<li></li>Worker
</ul>


Roles within each firm will be randomly assigned and remain constant throughout the experiment. There will be one authority, one manager, and one worker in each firm. The firm you are a part of will also remain constant throughout the experiment. It is important to note that your identity and role, as well as that of the other participants, will be kept PRIVATE.





During the experiment you will be asked to perform a simple math task and make decisions each period.  You will complete several practice rounds of the math task to familiarize yourself with it. The task consists of adding three 2-digit numbers, e.g., 31 + 23 + 45 = ___. You will have one minute to complete as many problems as possible.



There will be 15 periods during which the participants will perform tasks and make decisions based on their assigned roles. Group members’ payoffs and decisions will be tabulated and made visible to all members of a firm.  At the end of the experiment, ONE period will be randomly selected as the basis for payment, so you should treat each round as though it were the round for which you are being paid because it may be.



Roles in Each Period -





Worker

Workers must complete the math task to earn a wage. You will earn 100 Experimental Currency Units (ECU) for each correct answer. During each period, Managers can choose whether or not to take up to 50% of the ECUs from a randomly selected worker in any firm, and each worker in the session faces a 1/3 chance of being randomly selected as the target of this taking in each period. Each worker will observe the decision of the manager in his firm. A worker may choose to report their manager to the authority in their firm if they take ECUs from a worker. More on this later.



Manager

Managers also complete the math task to earn a wage. You will earn 100 Experimental Currency Units (ECU) for each correct answer. As a manager, you can improve your earnings by taking from a worker. If you choose to take from a worker, a worker will be randomly selected from the workers in the room. There is a 1/3 chance that the worker is from your firm. You will be asked, “do you want to take from a worker? If so, how much?” You can choose any integer amount from 0% to 50% to take from the chosen worker.



If you take from a worker, the worker in your firm can report you to the authority.



If reported, you face a 97% chance of being charged a fee of losing all of your earnings for that round. You can offer a transfer to the authority to reduce the likelihood of a being charged a fee. You will be asked, “if you are reported by the worker, will you make a transfer to the authority? If so, how much?” The authority faces a cost of T = 55 to intervene. If you make a transfer and the authority accepts it, you will face an α% chance that you will be charged a fee. This α is randomly assigned to each group after groups are formed, and each group will be aware of its value. Note that α is less than 97%.



Authority

Authorities earn a base salary of 500 ECUs. You can increase your earnings by performing the math task at a rate of 100 ECUs for each correct answer. You also choose whether or not to accept offered transfers from a manager who took earnings from a worker. Accepting the transfer reduces the likelihood of the manager charged a fee if a report was made. If you accept an offer to intervene, the manager will face a fee with probability 70%, and a 100 - 70% chance of not charged a fee. That is, a 30% chance of not charged a fee. Intervening costs you 55 ECUs. You will be asked, “If offered, will you accept the transfer?”



Reporting

Each worker chooses whether or not to report. Workers are asked, “if your manager took from a worker, will you report?” Reporting costs 100 ECUs. If a worker reports the manager, and the authority chooses not to intervene, there is a 97% chance that the manager will be charged a fee penalty. If, however, the authority chooses to intervene, there will be an 70% chance that the manager will pay a fee. If the manager is charged a fee after a report, the worker who reported the manager will receive a reward of 200 ECUs.



Some participants will answer some questions about the experiment. The instructions for the question will be provided on your screen if you are going to answer it.

Payment



There will be 15 decision-making periods in the experiment. Upon completion of all decision-making periods, you will be asked to complete a short questionnaire, parts of which you will be paid for. You will then be paid your total earnings, which is the sum of $7 show up fee, your earnings from the pre-game math task, the amount earned in one randomly selected period, and any earnings from the questionnaire. The exchange rate is $1 = 55 ECU. Are there any questions?
