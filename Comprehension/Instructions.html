    <p>This is an experiment in the economics of decision-making. The simple instructions are explained below. If you follow them carefully and make good decisions, you may earn a <strong>considerable amount of money</strong>, which will be <strong>paid to you in cash</strong> at the end of the experiment.</p>

    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>In this experiment, you will act as part of a firm. The participants in this room will be split up into 3 firms, with each participant receiving one of three roles within their firm. You will be assigned one of the following roles:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Authority</li>
        <li>Manager</li>
        <li>Worker</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Roles within each firm will be randomly assigned and remain constant throughout the experiment. There will be one authority, one manager, and one worker in each firm. The firm you are a part of will also remain constant throughout the experiment. It is important to note that your identity and role, as well as those of other participants, will be kept <strong>private</strong>.</p>

    <h3>Task and Decision Periods</h3>
    <p>During the experiment, you will be asked to perform a simple math task and make decisions each period. To familiarize yourself, you will complete several practice rounds of the math task, which consists of adding three 2-digit numbers, e.g., <span>31 + 23 + 45 = ___</span><span class="ai-readable">31 + 23 + 45 = blank</span>. You will have one minute to complete as many problems as possible.</p>

    <p>There will be 15 periods during which participants will perform tasks and make decisions based on their assigned roles. Group members’ payoffs and decisions will be tabulated and made visible to all members of a firm. At the end of the experiment, <strong>one period will be randomly selected</strong> as the basis for payment, so treat each round as though it were the round for which you are being paid.</p>

    <h3>Roles in Each Period</h3>

    <h4>Worker</h4>
    <p>Workers must complete the math task to earn a wage. You will earn 100 Experimental Currency Units (ECU) for each correct answer. During each period, Managers can choose whether or not to take up to 50% of the ECUs from a randomly selected worker in any firm, with each worker having a 1/3 chance of being chosen as the target. Each worker will observe the manager’s decision in their firm and may choose to report their manager if a taking occurs.</p>

    <h4>Manager</h4>

    <p>Managers also complete the math task to earn a wage, earning 100 ECUs for each correct answer. Managers can improve earnings by taking ECUs from a worker. If they choose to take, one worker in the room will be randomly selected, with a 1/3 chance that the chosen worker is from the manager’s own firm. Managers can choose any amount from 0% to 50% to take.</p>

    <p>If a manager takes from a worker, the worker may report the manager to the authority. If reported, the manager faces a 97% chance of losing all earnings for the round unless a transfer is offered to the authority. The transfer amount affects the likelihood of being charged a fee.</p>


    <h4>Authority</h4>

    <p>Authorities earn a base salary of 500 ECUs and can increase earnings by completing the math task (100 ECUs per correct answer). They may accept transfer offers from managers who have taken earnings from workers. Accepting the transfer reduces the likelihood of the manager facing a fee if reported. Intervening on behalf of a manager incurs a cost of 55 ECUs for the authority, with a reduced probability of the manager facing a fee.</p>


        <h3>Reporting</h3>
    <p>Workers can choose to report managers who take ECUs. Reporting costs 100 ECUs. If a worker reports a manager, and the authority does not intervene, there is a 97% chance of the manager facing a fee. If the authority intervenes, the chance decreases. A manager who pays a fee results in a reward of 200 ECUs to the worker who reported.</p>

    <h3>Experimental Flowchart</h3>
    <p>The actions within each period are summarized in the flowchart below:</p>

    <h3>Payment</h3>
    <p>There will be 15 decision-making periods. Upon completion, you will complete a short questionnaire with parts you will be paid for. You will then receive your total earnings, which include a $7 show-up fee, earnings from the pre-game math task, the amount earned in one randomly selected period, and any earnings from the questionnaire. The exchange rate is $1 = 55 ECU.</p>
