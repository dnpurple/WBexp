    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>In Part B, you will act as part of a group.
        The participants in this room will be split up into
        3 groups, with each participant receiving one of three
        roles within their group. </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Authority</li>
        <li>Manager</li>
        <li>Worker</li>
    </ul>

    <p>There will be one Authority, one Manager, and one Worker in each
        group. Roles in each group will be randomly assigned at the
        beginning of Part B and remain the same for the rest of the
        experiment. Your group will also remain the same throughout
        the experiment. It is important to note that your identity and
        role, as well as those of other participants, will be kept <strong>private</strong>.</p>

        <p>In Part B, you will make decisions in <strong> 20 periods </strong>. </p>

    <h1>In Each Period:</h1>

    <h3>Addition Task</h3>

    <p>You will perform the addition task at the start of each period. Managers and Workers will get 100 ECUs for each correct answer, identical to Part A. We will refer to these earnings as ‘earnings from the Addition Task’. Authorities get 500 ECUs as ‘earnings from the Addition Task’, regardless of whether and how many addition problems they solve correctly. All participants will be informed of their respective earnings on the Addition Task after completion. </p>

    <p>Thereafter, you will make decisions based on your assigned role.</p>



    <h3>Decision Task</h3>

    <h4>Manager</h4>
    <p>Managers decide whether to take part of a Worker’s earnings from the Addition Task. In each period, Managers will be randomly matched with 1 Worker in the room that they can take from.  There is a 1/3 chance that the selected Worker is from the Manager’s own group and a 2/3 chance that the Worker is from one of the other groups. Managers will see what the Worker they were randomly matched with earned in the addition task and can choose to take any amount from 0% to 50% of that Worker’s earnings from the Addition Task.</p>
    <p>The Worker in the Manager’s group may pay a fee to report their Manager to the Authority if their Manager took from the randomly matched Worker. If reported, the Manager faces a 97% chance of losing all earnings for the period. The Manager can reduce this likelihood if they offer a transfer to the Authority in their group and the Authority accepts. A transfer costs the Manager 60 ECUs.</p>
    <h4>Worker</h4>

    <p>As explained earlier, Managers can choose whether or not to take up to 50% of the ECUs from a randomly selected Worker in the room. A Worker can pay a fee to report the Manager in their group if their Manager takes from the randomly matched worker. Workers will state the minimum percentage taken for which they will make a report. Reporting costs the Worker 100 ECUs. If a Worker reports a Manager, and the Authority does not intervene, there is a 97% chance of the Manager losing his earnings for that period. If the Authority accepts a transfer from the Manager, the chance decreases. The Worker earns 200 ECUs for each successful report, i.e., when the Manager loses all his earnings. The worker who was taken from will not be reimbursed even if a report was successful.</p>

    <h4>Authority</h4>

    <p>Authorities may accept or reject transfer offers from the Manager in their group if the Manager has taken earnings from a randomly selected Worker. Accepting the transfer reduces the likelihood of the Manager losing their earnings if reported. Authorities earn 60 ECUs from accepting a transfer but incur a cost of 5 ECUs. Therefore, authorities earn a net of 55 ECUs if they accept a transfer. </p>

     <p>The likelihood of a successful report may change during the experiment. If it does, you will be notified.</p>

    <h2>Payment</h2>
    <p>There will be 20 decision-making periods. At the end of the
        experiment,<strong> one period will be randomly selected</strong>
        as the basis for payment, so treat each round as though it were the round for which you are being paid.
        Upon completion of all 20 periods, you will complete a short questionnaire, parts of which you will be paid for.
        You will then receive your total earnings, which include a $5 show-up fee,
        earnings from the pre-game math task, the amount earned in one randomly selected period,
        and any earnings from the questionnaire. Once again, the exchange rate is $1 = 55 ECUs.</p>
